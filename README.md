# A Tool for Approximating Radiotherapy Delivery via Informed Simulation (TARDIS).

A tool to generate a new DICOM-RT with predicted MLC positions with the input of DICOM-RT plan.

Tutorial:
* Download tool.py and the models.
* Open the tool.py with Python platform and run the script.
* At GUI, open desired DICOM-RT plan by clicking "Open" button.
* Choose one machine learning model based on treatment technique.
* Random error check box and percent of confidence interval  provdie an option to add a random component into the prediction. Random eror   components account for the unpredictable components in the machine learning model.
* A new DICOM-RT with predicted MLC positions, and command separate values (CSV) files including mechanical parameters and predicted MLC     errors and positions for individual field (arc) are then generated by clicking the “Run” button.  
* Re-import the new DICOM-RT into treatment planning system to evaluate the change in dose.
